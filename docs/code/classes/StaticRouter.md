# Class StaticRouter

Static router

It may be desirable to not do an additional request
for getting the api routes and instead bake them into
the code. To this avail, the &#x60;StaticRouter&#x60; can be
initialized with a POJO of { id, url, parameters }
whereas parameters are parts of the url which can be replaced.
