# Class Router

Basic router implementation for the ResourcefulApi.

Automagically creating api bound modules builds on
an understanding of the available routes. To
easily instantiate a Store bound to an endpoint,
route information for that endpoint must be provided.

Since every endpoint is implemented differently and
the choice where this route information comes from
should be left to the endpoint developer, this
library only assumes that route loading is usually an
asynchronous process which eventually returns and
has a set of keyed-by-name &#x60;Route&#x60; objects in
&#x60;this.routes&#x60;.
